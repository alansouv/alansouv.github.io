title: "Overview: My Journey Into Azure Cloud"
---

As a systems administrator, I’ve spent years managing physical servers, configuring networks, and troubleshooting infrastructure the traditional way — with racks, cables, and on-prem hardware. But the IT world is evolving fast, and cloud computing is no longer just a buzzword; it’s becoming the backbone of modern infrastructure.

To guide my transition from sysadmin to Azure Cloud Engineer, I’m following a structured and comprehensive roadmap: the Azure Cloud Engineer 6-Month Weekly Learning Plan. This plan breaks down the journey into manageable weekly goals, balancing theory, hands-on labs, and certifications. I’ll be sharing my progress, challenges, and insights as I work through each milestone.

To make this journey more engaging (and relatable), I’ll be framing each chapter around a fictional company where I’m the sole systems administrator tasked with leading their transition to the cloud. These story-driven scenarios will mirror the real-world challenges IT professionals face—bringing context and personality to the technical steps along the way.
