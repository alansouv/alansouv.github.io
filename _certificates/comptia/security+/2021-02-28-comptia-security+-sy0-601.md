title: "CompTIA Security+ SY0-601"

In this guide, I will go over how I prepared for the [CompTIA Security+ SY0-601][comptia-security-+-exam] exam.

CompTIA offers 2 different versions of the Security+, SY0-501 (retires July 31, 2021) and SY0-601.<br>
You can learn about the differences [here][cert-difference].

I chose to do the newer version (SY-601) of the Security+, but either version is fine.

I used the [CompTIA Security+ Certification Exam Objectives][exam-objectives] as a guideline on what the learn.

I used the following materials to prepare for the exam:
