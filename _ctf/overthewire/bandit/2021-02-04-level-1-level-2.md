<h2>Objective: Find password stored in - file located in the home directory</h2>

The `ls` command shows the - file in our current directory.

The only difference in this level is when you try to use the `cat` command on the - file, the terminal hangs after executing the command.

This is because the terminal is not interpreting - as a file, but rather as a a option flag for a parameter.
The terminal thinks that we are adding on a parameter to the `cat` command, but because nothing follows after the -, the command is incomplete and the terminal hangs.

By executing `cat ./-`, we are telling the terminal we want to perform the `cat` command on a file in our current location (`./` refers to the present working directory that we are in).
