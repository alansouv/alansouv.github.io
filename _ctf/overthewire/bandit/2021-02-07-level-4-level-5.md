<h2>Objective: Find password stored in the only human-readable file in the <b>inhere</b> directory</h2>

The `ls` command lists the <b>inhere</b> directory.

Execute `cd inhere` to change to the <b>inhere</b> directory.

The `ls` command shows us 10 different files, but only 1 of the 10 contains the password.

You could `cat` every file individually to see which one contains the password, but that would be pretty repetitive and time consuming.

The best option since we know one of the files is human-readable is to use the `file` command to determine file type.<br>
With the `file` command, we could execute `file ./-fileXX` for each file, but that would also be pretty repetitive.<br>

Since we have more than 1 file in the directory and we want to determine each file's file type, we include `*` in our command.

The `*` lets the terminal know that we want to display the file type for every file in the directory.<br>

Execute `file ./*` and we get the following output:

```
./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data
```
<u>Note:</u> If the filenames did not begin with a `-`, we could use `file *`, but because the terminal interprets `-` as adding on a parameter, we must add `./` before the `*`

Execute `cat ./-file07` to get the password.
