<h2>Objective: Find password stored in <b>spaces in this filename</b> file located in the home directory</h2>

The `ls` command shows the <b>spaces in this filename</b> file in our current directory.

If you try executing `cat spaces in this filename`, the terminal thinks you are trying to execute a `cat` command on 4 separate files - `cat spaces` `cat in` `cat this` `cat filename`.

To get the password successfully, you can do 2 different things.

1. `Tab` key completion.<br>
By entering `cat s` then pressing the `Tab` key, the command will auto-complete the rest of the filename for you.
This results in `cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename`. This works because the `\` (escape character) tells the terminal to read spaces as part of the filename and not as an actual space inbetween files.
2. Surround the filename with quotations.<br>
`cat 'spaces in this filename'` will tell the terminal that anything between the quotations is one whole entity.
