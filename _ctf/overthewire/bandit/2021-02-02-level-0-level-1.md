<h2>Objective: Find password stored in <b>readme</b> file located in the home directory</h2>

By using the `ls` command, we can list the contents of the current directory. (Using the `pwd` command shows us that our present working directory is `/home/bandit0`)

The `ls` command shows that our current directory contains a single file, <b>readme</b>.

We can then use the `cat` command on the <b>readme</b> file to get the password.
