Hello and welcome to my first (of many, hopefully) CTF challenge page. I have chosen to begin my CTF journey with [OverTheWire Wargames.][over-the-wire]


OverTheWire Wargames is a very popular & free CTF and it is a great place for beginners to learn and practice Cybersecurity concepts.<br>
There doesn't seem to be a recommended OS to use so I will be using Parrot OS.<br>
I will be following the suggested order to play the games in so I will be starting off with Bandit! :)

<b><u>Note:</u></b> These write-ups were created solely for learning purposes. Please do not use these write-ups as a step-by-step guide to complete the challenges. I have written each write-up quickly so there
may be key details missing. Please refer to the site to get all the information needed to complete each level.
I know posting spoilers/solutions is frowned upon so I have hidden every solution by default. Clicking the <button>Solution</button> button will reveal the solution for that level.
