Hello and welcome to my first (of many, hopefully) CTF challenge page. I have chosen to begin my CTF journey with [OverTheWire Wargames.][over-the-wire] 


OverTheWire Wargames is a very popular & free CTF and it is a great place for beginners to learn and practice Cybersecurity concepts.<br>
There doesn't seem to be a reccomended OS to use so I will be using Parrot OS.<br>
We will be following the suggested order to play the games in so we will be starting off with Bandit! :)

<b><u>Note:</u></b> These write-ups were created solely for learning purposes. Please do not use these write-ups as a step-by-step guide to complete the challenges.
I know posting spoilers/solutions is frowned upon so I have hidden every answer behind a <b><u>Answer Button,</u></b> which when pressed will reveal the answer for that level.

<h2>Bandit: Absolute Beginners</h2>
Note: Make sure you read the <i>[Note for beginners][note-for-beginners]</i> for some tips!<br>
