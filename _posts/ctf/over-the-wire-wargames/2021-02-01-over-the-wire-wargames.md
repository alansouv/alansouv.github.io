Hello and welcome to my first (of many, hopefully) CTF challenge page. I have chosen [OverTheWire Wargames][over-the-wire] to begin my Cybersecurity journey.


OverTheWire Wargames is a popular free CTF & is a great place for beginners to start learning and practicing Cybersecurity concepts. 
The site has a suggested order to play the games in (Bandit being the first) so we will start there :)

Note: Make sure you read the <i>[Note for beginners][note-for-beginners]</i> for some tips!<br>
