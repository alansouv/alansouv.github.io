Hello and welcome to my first (of many, hopefully) CTF challenge page. I have chosen [OverTheWire Wargames][over-the-wire] to begin my Cybersecurity journey.


OverTheWire Wargames is a popular free CTF & is a great place for beginners to start learning and practicing Cybersecurity concepts.<br>
There doesn't seem to be a reccomended OS to use so I will be using Parrot OS.<br>
The site has a suggested order to play the games in so we will be starting with Bandit :)

<b><u>Note:</u></b> These writeups are meant to be for learning purposes. Please do not use these write ups as a step-by-step guide to complete the challenges.
I know posting spoilers/solutions is frowned upon so I will try my best to not do that but as a warning, all of the posts following this <b><u>may contain</u></b> spoilers and quite possibly the solutions.

<h2>Bandit: Absolute Beginners</h2>
Note: Make sure you read the <i>[Note for beginners][note-for-beginners]</i> for some tips!<br>
