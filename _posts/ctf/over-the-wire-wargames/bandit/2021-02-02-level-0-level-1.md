<h2>Objective: Find password stored in <b>readme</b> file</h2>

By using the `ls` command, we can list the contents of the current directory. (Using the `pwd` command shows us that our present working directory is `/home/bandit0`)

The `ls` command shows that our current directory contains a single file, <b>readme</b>.

We can use the `cd ../` command to change to the `/home/` directory, where we find a bunch of directories that start with `bandit` followed by a number, but no <b>readme</b> file.<br>
<u>Note:</u> `cd ../` lets us go down one directory from our current directory (`/home/bandit0` to `/home`)

Returning to the `/home/bandit0` directory by using the `cd` command, we can then use the `cat` command on the <b>readme</b> file to get the password.
